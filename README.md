### Unexpected Phenomenon 1: Ridership by Age
Riders born in the early 1900's have higher average trip duration than riders born in more recent years. Also, riders born between 1940's and 2000 have almost equal average trip duration across the six month period.

Riders born in 1969 travelled the most miles, in the six-month period. Also, most participation was recorded by riders born in 1969 across the six-month period. This is quite unexpected, considering the age of the riders born in 1959 and the fact that they were still more active riders than those born in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, who are supposed to be younger and more active. 

Total ridership grew from August to September 2020. However, it began to drop from October 2020 up until January 2021.

### Unexpected Phenomenon 2: Change in Ridership within the Six-Month Period
Total ridership grew from August to September 2020. However, it began to drop from October 2020 up until December 2020, and it began to rise again in January 2021.

With the freezing weather and the volume of snow in January compared to the previous months, one would expect a further decline into January 2021, but rather there was a rise in the ridership.

### Unexpected phenomenon 3: Bike Usage in Summer and Winter Months
The peak hours when bike rides were started in winter months were between 12noon and 6pm. The peak hours when bike rides were ended in winter months were between 12noon and 6pm. This duration is likely due to the daylight hours in the winter months. However, the lower end of the time (12 noon) indicated a late start to the day, which could be as a result of the pandemic from 2020 till date.

The peak hours when bike rides are started in summer months are between 8am and 8pm. The peak hours when bike rides were ended in summer month (August) were between 8amm and 8pm. This is likely due to the longer day experienced in the summer months.
